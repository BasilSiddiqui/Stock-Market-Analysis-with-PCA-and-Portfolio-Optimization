# Stock Market Analysis with PCA and Portfolio Optimization

## Overview
This project performs a comprehensive analysis of stock prices, log returns, and portfolio optimization using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The workflow includes data retrieval, statistical analysis, visualization, and portfolio performance evaluation.

## Features
- **Stock Data Retrieval**: Load and preprocess stock price data.
- **Log Returns Calculation**: Compute log returns for time-series analysis.
- **PCA Analysis**: Reduce dimensionality and extract key market trends.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Construct and compare different portfolios.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate histograms, time-series plots, and cumulative return comparisons.
- **CSV Export**: Save key results for further analysis.
